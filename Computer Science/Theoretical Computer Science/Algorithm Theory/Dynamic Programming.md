**Dynamic programming** describes an approach to reduce the search space of a problem by saving intermediate solutions. 

The approach usually includes: finding a way to divide the problem in subproblems which are simple to solve, finding a way to save computed results so that they can be reused, and finally building on top of already computed solutions to reach a result for the whole problem.

This process happens either bottom-up (finding the simplest smallest solutions at first) or top-down (starting at the top of the search tree and either reusing a saved solution, or branching further to simpler solutions).
