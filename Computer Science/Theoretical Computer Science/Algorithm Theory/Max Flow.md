A **Max Flow** problem is an algorithmic problem in a directed acyclic graph, with edges which have a positive capacity. There are also nodes which have only in-going edges, and nodes which only have out-going edges. The goal is to find the maximum flow (a numeric value for each edge which is no greater than the capacity) in this graph.

A lot of problems can be modelled with a Flow Graph.
