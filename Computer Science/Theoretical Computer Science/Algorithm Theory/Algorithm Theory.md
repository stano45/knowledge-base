**Algorithm theory** is a subfield of [[Computer Science]], which studies everything about algorithms: classification ([[Greedy Algorithms]], [[Dynamic Programming]], [[Divide and Conquer]], [[Max Flow]], [[Linear Programming]]...), their [[Complexity]], correctness and optimality. 

There are also ways to reduce the exponential search space of [[NP]] problems, for example fixed parameter tractability.

Hard problems which cannot be reduced further can be approximated to some degree, usually using [[Greedy Algorithms]].
