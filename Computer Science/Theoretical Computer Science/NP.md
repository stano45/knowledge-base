**NP** is a class of problems in [[Compexity|complexity theory]], which can be solved in polynomial time by a non-deterministic Turing-Machine. In reality (on standard, non-theoretical machines), these problems cannot be solved in polynomial time.

NP-hard problems: For every problem in NP there exists a poly-time reduction to every NP-hard problem.

NP-complete: problems which are NP-hard but also NP.
