**Distributed Systems** is an area of [[Computer Science]], where the goal is to design a system infrastructure, in which multiple nodes (components, [[Hardware]], [[Virtual Machines]], [[Process|processes|]], etc..) communicate by passing messages.

There are multiple challenges in building such an infrastructure, including:
- Synchronization
- Scalability
- Heterogenity
- Transparency
- Quality of Service
- etc.
