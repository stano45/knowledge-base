In computing, a **virtual machine (VM)** is the virtualization/emulation of a computer system. Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide functionality of a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination.

In contrast to [[Docker]], Virtual machines have a host operating system and a guest operating system inside each VM.
